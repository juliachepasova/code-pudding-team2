            Michael Lembeck takes the top place as the most successful Friends
            director in terms of episode viewership. He has contributed to
            directing a significant number of Friends' episodes, 10% or 24
            episodes. This puts him in the top 3 for total number of Friends'
            episodes directed. Michael Lembeck is responsible for the highest
            viewed episode in the entire series (The One After The Superbowl,
            Season 2, Episode 12/13), and furthermore his directed episodes have
            the highest average viewership compared to the other 'core'
            directors.
          </p>
          <p class="conclusion__paragraph conclusion__paragraph_content_second">
            Although Michael clearly rises to the top when we only look at
            viewership numbers, there are other factors that could be explored.
            For example, how does Michael Lembeck directed episodes correlate to
            episode ratings and do those episodes tend to rank higher? The
            writers are also an important factor in the content of the episode,
            and is there a stronger correlation with the writers of the episodes
            over the director?
