            <i>Friends</i> first hit our screens over 28 years ago! It is
            undeniably one of the biggest sitcoms and continues to be a favorite
            of many. As the show follows the real life adventures of six friends
            living out their 20s in New York City, we get to see the evolution
            of the show’s popularity. This was our starting point.
          </p>
          <p
            class="introduction__paragraph introduction__paragraph_content_second"
          >
            We merged two datasets that were available: friends_episodes and
            friends_imbd. Combined, our final table provides us with information
            about each 236 episodes along with metrics related to how each
            episode performed (number of views, votes, imdb rating). We also
            added additional features to count the number of main character
            lines and the number of words they spoke.

            We thought it would be interesting to learn more about the show’s
            popularity through the director’s lens. Together, we will explore
            whether the show’s success has anything to do with who was directing
            the episodes.

        <section class="roles">
          <h2 class="roles__title">Director, Producer, Showrunner🤔</h2>
          <p class="roles__paragraph roles__paragraph_content_first">
            These terms get easily confused. Let’s start with the producer. They
            are at the top of the hierarchy and have more responsibility than a
            tv show director because they make all the business and financial
            decisions.
          </p>
          <p class="roles__paragraph roles__paragraph_content_second">
            The showrunner is always the executive producer and the show stays
            consistent thanks to them. For Friends, the co-creators, Marta
            Kauffman and David Crane hold this role. Generally speaking, the
            showrunner is also a writer on the show. Ok, now I see how these
            roles can get confusing 😅
          </p>
          <p class="roles__paragraph roles__paragraph_content_third">
            The director (unless they are also a producer of the show) is hired
            by the producer to bring the creative vision of the show to life.
            You would be right to think that his role includes planning the
            camera angles and guiding actors on set.

            Number of Episodes by Director
          </h2>
          <p class="episodes-by-director__paragraph">
            To our surprise, there are 29 directors on the show! That would
            equate to about 8 episodes per director. We found that the episodes
            were not distributed equally - some directors directed over 10
            times, while others only once. Yeah, that’s a pretty big difference!
            We dug in to find out exactly how many episodes were directed by
            each director. Fun fact: David Schwimmer (or Ross from the show) was
            also the director of some of the episodes throughout the seasons.
            But what exactly is the role of director and why are there so many
            of them?

        <section class="viewerships">
          <h2 class="viewerships__title">The One About The Episodes</h2>

          <p class="viewerships__paragraph">
            One of the reasons for having as many directors is to shift the tv
            show in a new position if it’s not gaining success or to keep it
            fresh with new ideas. Based on the average viewers per season and
            views per episode gained during the first three seasons of
            <i>Friends</i>, this might not be true for the start of the show.
            However, this may have been more likely for seasons 6 and 7 where
            the views per episode were not as high throughout the season. Season
            2 has the highest average viewers of ~32 million, compared to season
            7 that has the lowest of ~22 million. The highest viewed episodes
            out of the entire show are ‘The One After the Superbowl: Part 1’ and
            ‘The One After the Superbowl: Part 2’. Both directed by Michael
            Lembeck. Having multiple directors also allows directors to work on
            other projects at the same time to diversify their work. Ben Weiss,
            for example, directed the pilot episode for
            <i>Veronica's Closet</i> in 1997, the same year he directed episodes
            in season 3 of <i>Friends</i>. On top of that, in the US, a
            producer’s contract may allot a set number of days for
            pre-production, production and post-production. Assuming that each
            episode takes about a week to shoot, it wouldn't be possible for one
            director to do it all. While a director is shooting, you would find
            another working on the post-production of the previous episode and
            another preparing for the next episode.

            Michael Lembeck takes the top place as the most successful
            <i>Friends</i> director in terms of episode viewership. He has
            contributed to directing a significant number of <i>Friends</i>'
            episodes, 10% or 24 episodes. This puts him in the top 3 for total
            number of <i>Friends</i>' episodes directed. Michael Lembeck is
            responsible for the highest viewed episode in the entire series (The
            One After The Superbowl, Season 2, Episode 12/13), and furthermore
            his directed episodes have the highest average viewership compared
            to the other 'core' directors.
          </p>
          <p class="conclusion__paragraph conclusion__paragraph_content_second">
            Although Michael clearly rises to the top when we only look at
            viewership numbers, there are other factors that could be explored.
            For example, how does Michael Lembeck directed episodes correlate to
            episode ratings and do those episodes tend to rank higher? The
            writers are also an important factor in the content of the episode,
            and is there a stronger correlation with the writers of the episodes
            over the director?
